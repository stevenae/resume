\item I was a data scientist at the White House [United States Digital Service] (January 2023\,- June 2023). I supported the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico. We produced the first definitive analysis of federal funding for Puerto Rico and identified critical gaps in reporting compliance.

\item I was the first data scientist, at Brick [now 'GoBuild'] (July  2020\,-\,June 2021). I developed the company's product, an AI tool which used computer vision to estimate the effect of home renovations on resale value. We successfully raised a seed round based on this product. I left to travel.

\item I was the first data scientist at Divvy Homes (September  2018\,-\,June 2020). I built and deployed AI home pricing and credit tools. These online, machine-learning based products contributed to a successful series B fundraise. My team also compiled the first company-wide analytics dashboard for investors. I hired and managed two data scientists. I left to join Brick.

\item I was the sixth data scientist at Uber (May  2014\,-\,December  2016).  I quantified the value of business partnerships via causal inference methods and resolved hazardous flaws in Uber's feature rollout infrastructure. I served as the primary company-wide experiment and feature roll-out expert. I left to take time off. 

\item I was a quantitative user experience researcher at Google (April  2011\,-\,April  2014).  While there, I guided pricing and product strategy via discrete-choice methods. I also identified surrogate geographic research regions via exact-test statistics and designed production experiments. I left to join Uber.
