\item I was a data scientist at the White House [United States Digital Service] (January 2023 -- June 2023). I supported the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico. I produced the first comprehensive analysis of federal funding for Puerto Rico and identified critical gaps in reporting compliance. I retain my Top-Secret clearance.
\item I was the first data scientist at Brick [now 'GoBuild'] (July 2020 -- June 2021). I developed the company's product, an AI tool which used computer vision to estimate the effect of home renovations on resale value. We successfully raised a seed round based on this product.
\item I was the first data scientist at Divvy Homes (September 2018 -- June 2020). I built and deployed AI home pricing and credit tools. These on-line, machine learning-based products contributed to a successful series B fundraise. My team also compiled the first company-wide analytics dashboard for investors. I hired and managed two data scientists.
\item I was the sixth data scientist at Uber (May 2014 -- December 2016).  I quantified the value of business partnerships via causal inference methods and resolved hazardous flaws in Uber's feature roll-out infrastructure. I served as the primary company-wide experiment and feature roll-out expert.
\item I was a quantitative user experience researcher at Google (April 2011 -- April 2014).  While there, I guided pricing and product strategy via discrete-choice methods. I also identified surrogate geographic research regions via exact-test statistics and designed production experiments.
